## About

**Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in [any](https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code) programming language you like. People use them as a [speed contest](https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard), [interview prep](https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/), [company training](https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137), [university coursework](https://www.gribblelab.org/scicomp2018/), [practice problems](https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584), or to [challenge each other](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&restrict_sr=on).

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some [problem solving skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/) will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
